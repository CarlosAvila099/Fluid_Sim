# Development Log
## Tasks
For this project, we were given a functional fluid simulator and we needed to add 4 principal parts.
* Create multiple sources of velocity and density, via command line or file.
* Animate velocity forces, there must be 2 behaviors.
* Create color schemas for the simulation.
* Simulate presence of objects in the simulation.
